<!-- *Hi! I have been working in the tech industry since 2010 and I’ve been a Computer Scientist, most of the time I worked as a software engineer but in the last few years I’ve enjoyed working as a Quantitative Researcher*

*I’m a Ph.D. student in mathematical optimization and I’ve got a master’s degree in Deep Learning, Graduate Studies in Database Management, and Agile Software Development with a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Systems. With a focus on quantitative finance and financial services, I am passionate about science and machine learning, working as a researcher primarily on the following topics: portfolio optimization, fraud prevention, pattern recognition, operational research, and financial services in a general way.*

*I have solved problems in fields such as Clustering, Anomaly Detection, problems related to financial areas, problems like fraud detection, forecasts, and all kinds of solutions related to finance, building valuable ML products since their conception, through development and productization.*

*I really consider myself to be a team player. I like to work with other people and I find that it’s much easier to achieve something when everyone works together and communicates well.*

*I’m really ambitious. I have always set myself goals and it motivates me to work hard. I have achieved my goals so far with my training, education, and work experience and now I am looking for ways to improve myself and grow.*

*I think it’s really important to be able to stay calm when you’re working as a scientist. It can get really stressful, but one of my greatest qualities is that I can keep my cool and not allow the pressure to get to me, which helps me achieve all my goals and remain focused.*

*Nice to meet you!* -->


*Hi,*

*Since childhood, I’ve always been fascinated by puzzles—not the colorful, jigsaw kind, but the ones that challenge logic and demand creativity to solve. Today, as a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, I’ve turned that passion into a professional journey dedicated to unraveling complex problems through data—always with a clear purpose: to meaningfully impact people and businesses.*

*My path began in academia, where I immersed myself in Deep Learning and pattern recognition during my master's degree. It was there that I truly understood the power of data—not just for prediction, but for transforming realities. At the Computer Vision Lab, I developed pipelines to extract meaning from images, but what motivated me most was seeing how detected anomalies could, for example, improve medical diagnoses or optimize industrial processes.*

<!-- *I carried this vision of impactful data into the corporate world through data science. Leading a team and building an anti-fraud product wasn’t just about precise algorithms—it was about protecting entrepreneurs and users who relied on the platform while also driving business impact beyond model performance. The result? An 86% increase in resolved fraud cases. Behind those numbers are real people who could run their businesses with greater security.* -->

*Today, my work in mathematical optimization goes beyond formulas. It’s about helping institutions make the best decisions that balance risk, cost, and return—which, at the end of the day, means safeguarding the assets of families and investors. When I model a portfolio, I think about how every optimized percentage can translate into educational opportunities or someone’s retirement.*

*My technical expertise—Python, C/C++, Java, algorithmic complexity, or solvers like Gurobi—are just tools. What defines me is the ability to translate real-world problems into mathematical language and then into clear solutions for stakeholders. Whether explaining a complex model to a CEO or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I believe data science only makes sense when communicated with clarity and empathy.*

*My mission is to use optimization and machine learning not as ends in themselves, but as tools to build fairer, more efficient, and transparent systems—whether in academia or industry.*

*Because in the end, data is about people and institutions. And it’s for them that I solve problems.*


<!-- *Greetings,*

*I possess extensive experience within the technology sector dating back to 2010, predominantly serving as a Computer Scientist. While my background predominantly revolves around software engineering, I have recently found fulfilment as a Quantitative Researcher.*

*Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematical optimization, I hold a master’s degree in Deep Learning, with prior postgraduate studies encompassing Database Management and Agile Software Development. My academic journey culminated in a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Systems. My professional focus lies within quantitative finance and financial services, with a fervent interest in science and machine learning. Within my research capacity, I concentrate on portfolio optimization, fraud prevention, pattern recognition, operational research, and broader financial services domains.*

*My expertise spans diverse problem domains including Clustering, Anomaly Detection, and various financial intricacies such as fraud detection and forecasting. Throughout my career, I have consistently contributed to the development and productization of valuable machine learning solutions from inception to deployment.*

*Collaboration is integral to my approach, as I thrive in team environments where effective communication fosters collective achievement.
*
*Driven by ambition, I continuously set and achieve goals, leveraging my educational background and professional experience. I am now seeking avenues for further personal and professional growth.*

*Maintaining composure amid the rigors of scientific inquiry is paramount. My ability to remain calm under pressure has been instrumental in attaining my objectives and sustaining focus.*

*It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.* -->
