### UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE CAMPINA GRANDE | 2020-2021
The main goal of my M.Sc. was to develop a new Pattern recognition system to detect and predicts the urban growth. Thus, an anomaly detection system was proposed, through satellite images besides Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques. The final results confirmed that we were able to track identifiers of changes in the earth's surface temporally with satisfactory results.

A Predictive Analysis Approach Using Linear Regression To Estimate Software Effort - Making decisions with a highly uncertain level is a critical problem in the area of software engineering. Predicting software quality requires high accurate tools and high-level experience. AI-based predictive models, on the other hand, are useful tools with an accurate degree that help to make decisions learning from past data. In this study, we build a software effort estimation model to predict the effort before the project development lifecycle, using a linear regression model and also using non-parametric validation model through a Knn regression algorithm.
