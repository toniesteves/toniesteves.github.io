title: The 10 insighs I learned in the transition from Developer to Data Scientist.
description: Some time ago (more precisely 4 years ago) I started my data career journey. My background has always been in technology, so I didn't have so much trouble dealing with libraries and programming languages. However, I made a key turning point in certain aspects that made me evolve in the data area and perceive certain situations from other perspectives. So, based on my little experience in the data area, I decided to list some points that I was decisive in my career for this turning point.

> *The insights listed here are based on my own experience over the last 4 years. It is NOT the absolute truth, under any circumstances, because as I highlight below, people have different backgrounds, leading to different insights, under different aspects. The topics below are a mere summary of my personal experience.*


So, let's go to the points that I can highlight in my little journey through the world of data.


- **Understand that the research environment differs from the production environment.** As robust as a product is, whether in the research environment, sometimes it can be unfeasible for the production environment - We can use a batch model as an example fraud detection system that uses 1-year IP access history, accounting for 16M lines.

- **Does the data we have really answer the question we want to answer?** We often believe we have "all the necessary data" and in fact we do, however, this data may not answer the questions we are trying to answer.

- **Timeline. "Do we already have a delivery date?"** Considering the MVP concept, yes. However, from the point of view of the complete product, it is very complex to estimate a delivery date in an absolute way. AI/ML projects don't handle calendar so well.

- **"Will we be able to achieve the objective?"** The guarantee of achieving the objective in an absolute and satisfactory way for ALL stakeholders is sometimes complex to estimate, transforming this degree of uncertainty inherent to artificial intelligence projects. That is, AI/DS/ML projects totally differ from software projects, where we know where we came from and we are sure that we will be able to reach the agreed product, while in an AI project we are always re-evaluating data, algorithms, questions to reach a metric. acceptable for the business (As long as your customer expects 100% accuracy).

- **Human and exact sciences are closely related.** It is very common in an alignment meeting for a marketing specialist to ask about contexts, situations, dialogues and indicators for you to transform them into numbers, statistics, matrices and equations of linear algebra, something we're not really taught or used to. No DS company hires you to simply "find the value of x".

- **The process is not as iterative and incremental as you might think.** Sometimes you will train, configure, retrain, evaluate result, add data, retrain, configure, etc. Also, the reverse engineering process to re-evaluate where you went wrong is more common than you might think, several times you need to go back to where you went wrong, but you still don't know where that point is.

- **Building something from scratch is often the best solution.** Unlike what happens in software engineering, where we prefer to use the tool/library that does everything in the most automated way possible, implementing more complex algorithms and functions is almost always best. The level of control you will have over your experiments will be much greater

- **Business at all times.** Despite being as beautiful an area as the hype allows, DS/ML/DL are problem-solving areas. In the end, the customer doesn't care if you built the architecture or the pipeline using the principles described in the most advanced software engineering book. I don't want to encourage technical debt with this point, but to promote a culture of MVP's and feedback, because the faster you fail, the faster you will reach the desired solution.

- **Machine Learning isn't everything.** What good is the best model if your model doesn't receive this data efficiently? Several times it will be necessary to go back a few places and review how a table is storing a certain category of data, or if an index was created correctly. Be prepared to quickly change the paradigm/perspective, stop thinking about business for a moment, think more technically and go back to thinking about business again.

- **Timming is everything.** Digging right at the wrong time and place is also digging wrong (at least in my opinion). The delivery of data or data products at the right time is a key factor for both your growth and the business area. Data and situations change constantly and all the time. Understanding the moment when a delivery will add value to the business is of fundamental importance, otherwise the possibility of adding value will pass and with it the opportunity for a possible insight will also pass.
